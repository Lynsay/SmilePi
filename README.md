# SmilePi

The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated guidance regarding the wearing of masks presents communication challenges.  This Python code draws a rudimentary smile on a Unicorn pHAT (colourful LED matrix) from Pimoroni.  This has the potential to be placed with a facemask to add a bit of cheer :)
